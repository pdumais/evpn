type 2 will be used to advertise the vtep and vni that a mac can be reached at
    type 2: mac/vtep assciation:
        sudo ip netns exec evpn-1 ./gobgp global rib -a evpn add macadv 11:22:33:44:55:66 0.0.0.0 etag 0 label 242 rd 192.168.1.2:242 nexthop 10.0.0.103 encap vxlan

test: add a 4th host and see if all the plumbing was done automatically: Should be able to ping across hosts

multiple overlays (VRF)
    using VNI
        split vlans on bridge
        assign VNI to vlans. There is a a functioanlity to do this already in linux

        when adding a vtep with type3, we would have multiple "00:00:00:00:00:00 -> vtep" but different vni.
            the vxlan iface would be part of all vlans.
            it would then need to map the source vlan to the right VNI. 
                what if no vtep with such VNI defined?

            When I have 2 entries like this:
                00:00:00:00:00:00 dev vxlan1 dst 10.0.0.102 self permanent
                00:00:00:00:00:00 dev vxlan1 dst 10.0.0.102 vni 243 self permanent
            a broadcast (arp) would send out 1 vxlan per VNI, so I see 2.
                so there must be a way to separate this using vlans
